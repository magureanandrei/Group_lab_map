An airline requires a small application to manage passenger bookings for specific flights. Users can log into the app either as an operator or as a passenger.
As a passenger, you have the following options: 
  
  a. Book a ticket for a displayed flight.
  
  b. Reserve a spot for when a flight becomes available with the desired criteria. 
  
  c. Delete or update your reservations/tickets.

As an operator, you can: 

  a. Create a new flight, which requires assigning a pilot, a plane, a departure airport, a destination airport, and any waiting passengers, then adding it to the list of available flights for other passengers to book. 
  
  b. Display a list of passengers for a specific flight.
  
  c. Display a list of available pilots. 
  
  d. Display a list of available planes.

The application allows passengers to book a seat on a specific flight. If no seats are available, the passenger will receive a notification and can either book a different flight or reserve a spot for a possible future flight that matches the desired criteria. The application can also display flights with available seats, along with the number of seats still open for booking.

The application enables viewing of passengers who have booked a specific flight.
